## What Software Engineering means to me (Homework 1)
Software Engineering to me is a foundational building block in the computer science field. It is a basis on truly learning how to code and develop for the real world. While this class may be challenging, it is important to understand the foundations this class is going to present, and is going to be vital for future positions and jobs hopefully to come. I hope to leave this class with a lot of real world examples and understanding of what I am about to get myself in to when I go into the job field.

## Why I am taking Software Engineering(Homework 2)
I'm taking software engineering because I personally feel like it is going to be one of the most important classes I take at Xavier. I feel like this class will translate in to real world application a lot, so I dont wanna be on the wrong side of the road and not take it. I also have loved most of my classes involving CS, so I hope to feel the same about this one. I hope to get tons of new coding experience out of this class, and to learn some new problem solving and debugging strategies.
